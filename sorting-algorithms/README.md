# sorting-algorithms

## Introduction
This project consists of a comparative analysis of the execution times of three popular sorting algorithms in Python: Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, and Merge Sort.

## Implemented Algorithms

- **Bubble Sort**: A simple algorithm that repeatedly traverses the list, comparing adjacent elements and swapping them if they are in the wrong order.
- **Insertion Sort**: An algorithm that builds a sorted list one element at a time, moving unsorted elements to the correct position in the sorted list.
- **Merge Sort**: An algorithm that divides the list into smaller sublists, sorts these sublists, and merges them to produce a sorted list.

## Results
The execution times of each algorithm for different input sizes are recorded and stored in a dictionary. Then, the average execution times for each type of algorithm are calculated.
